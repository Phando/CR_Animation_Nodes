A comprehensive suite of nodes to enhance your animations

CR Animation Nodes
A comprehensive suite of nodes to enhance your animations.

These nodes include some features similar to Deforum, and also some new ideas.

If you would like to contribute to this project with suggestions or feedback then please DM me on the AI Revolution discord, add feature requests on Gtithub, or leave a comment below.

Example Videos
These YouTube short videos were made by AI Music Experiment and made use of early versions of the nodes.

## Demo Workflows
Four demo workflows are included in the download. These are designed to demonstrate how the nodes function. They are not full animation workflows. Full template workflows will be published when the project nears completion.

## Recommended Downloads
The following node packs are recommended for building workflows using these nodes:

Comfyroll Custom Nodes

the CR Animation nodes were orginally based on nodes in this pack

Fizz Nodes

for the Prompt Scheduler

MTB

for the Animation Controller and several other nodes

## Compatibility
These nodes are designed to work with both Fizz Nodes and MTB Nodes. We are also looking at testing with Loopchain.

# List Of Nodes
These are the first 20 nodes. There are 35 nodes currently in development. It is planned to release these in multiple drops during September.

Feedback on the new nodes is welcomed.
